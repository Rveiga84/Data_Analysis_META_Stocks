        <p class="lead">Hi there! I'm excited that you've landed on my page. My name is Rafael and I'm learning all about the awesome things we can do with data. I'm really new to this, but I'm loving every bit of it, especially when I use a special tool called R to help me out.

This page is like a scrapbook for all the cool projects I've worked on so far. Each one has taught me something new about how to turn messy data into shiny insights. They've also helped me get better at finding hidden patterns, making predictions, and telling compelling stories from data.

I've put together these projects with lots of love and care, and I really hope you'll enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed creating them. Plus, I think they'll give you a good idea of what I can do (and that I'm getting better every day!).

If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to say hi, please don't hesitate to reach out. I love talking about data and I'm always looking to learn more. So take a look around, have fun, and let's discover the magic of data together.</p>
